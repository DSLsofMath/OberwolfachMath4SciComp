These are the files from the presentation of the implementation of
interval analysis and applications:

IA.lhs         -- implementation of interval analysis
IN.lhs         -- interval Newton method
Z.lhs          -- finding zeros via bisection
K.lhs          -- Krawczyk method
O.lhs          -- global optimization via bisection
AD.lhs         -- automatic differentiation (Monday's presentation)

Additionally, there is a small collection of definitions not strictly
related to any particular example, Util.lhs.
