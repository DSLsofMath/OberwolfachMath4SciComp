These are the modified versions of the applications of interval
analysis, exposing folds and unfolds and various fusion laws.

IN.lhs         -- interval Newton method
Z.lhs          -- finding zeros via bisection
K.lhs          -- Krawczyk method
O.lhs          -- global optimization via bisection
OM.lhs         -- global optimization written monadic style

You will still need Util.lhs and AD.lhs to typecheck and compile 
these programs.
